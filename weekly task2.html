        <h2> <B>A Breif History of HTML</B></h2>
               <h3><b>1993 - Present</b></h3>
        <p>The first version of HTML was written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993. Since then,<br> there have been many different versions of HTML. The most widely used <br> version throughout the 2000's was <b>HTML 4.01</b>, which became an official <br> standard in December 1999</p>

        <p>
            Another version, <b>XHTML</b>, was a rewrite of HTML as an XML language. XML is <br> a standard markup language that is used to create other markup languages. <br> Hundreds of XML languages are in use today, including GML (Geography <br> Markup Language), MathML, MusicML, and RSS (Really Simple Syndication). <br> Since each of these languages was written in a common language (XML), <br> their content can easily be shared across applications. This makes XML <br> potentially very powerful, and it's no surprise that the W3C would create an <br> XML version of HTML (again, called XHTML). XHTML became an official <br> standard in 2000, and was updated in 2002. XHTML is very similar to HTML, <br> but has stricter rules. Strict rules are necessary for all XML languages, <br> because without it, interoperability between applications would be impossible. <br> You'll learn more about the differences between HTML and XHTML in <a href="">Unit 2.</a>

            Most pages on the Web today were built using either HTML 4.01 or XHTML <br> 1.0. However, in recent years, the W3C (in collaboration with another <br> organization, the  <a href="">WHATWG)</a>, has been working on a brand new version of <br> HTML,  <b>HTML5</b>. Currently (2011), HTML5 is still a draft specification, and is <br> not yet an official standard. However, it is already widely supported by <br> browsers and other web-enabled devices, and is the way of the future. <br> Therefore,<b> HTML5 is the primary language taught in this course. </b>

    <h2><b>Examples of types of content that can be included on web pages</b></h2>
    <p>
        The following table shows a list of many of the types of content that can be <br> added to web pages using different versions of HTML. In the early days of the <br> Web, HTML (version 1.2) was very simple, but over time new versions were <br> released that added more and more features. Still, if web designers wanted to <br> add content or features that HTML didn't support, they would have to do so <br> with non-standard proprietary technologies such as Adobe Flash. These <br> technologies would require users to install browser plug-ins, and in some <br> cases meant that certain users would be unable to access the content (for <br> example, iPhones and iPads don't support Flash). 
</p> 

      <p>HTML5 has added support for many new features that will make it possible to <br> do more with HTML, without relying on non-standard proprietary technologies</p>
